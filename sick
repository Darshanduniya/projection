Request for Sick Leave

Dear [Manager’s Name],

As per my recent blood test reports, my platelet count and white blood cell (WBC) count are both low. Due to this, my health condition is not stable and I need to take rest for 1–2 days.

Once I recover, I will resume work and log in as usual. I will also share the medical report for your reference.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
